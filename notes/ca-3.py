Stack

Hardware:
PUSH Put something on the Stack
POP Take something off the Stack

You can add these if needed

PEEK Look at the item on top of the stack
IS_EMPTY Is the stack empty or not

Need these to implement a stack:

* List a place to store the data that we push, RAM or Registers
* The location in the list on the top of the stack.


Let's:
* Store the stack data in RAM
* Use R7 to hold the address of the top of the stack
    * Gets initialized to 0xf4 when the machine boots up
